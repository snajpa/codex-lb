"""Durable state for one OIDC round trip, plus the cookie that binds it to a browser.

Two things hold a flow together and the callback needs both. The **row** is
race-free but binds to nobody: anyone holding a leaked ``state`` could finish a
flow somebody else started. The **cookie** binds to the browser but is not
single-use: two callbacks presenting it both read it, and clearing it is a
read-then-write. So the row is consumed by one conditional ``DELETE`` -- exactly
one caller in the fleet wins it -- and the cookie must carry the same ``state``
the URL does.

The clear ``state`` and ``nonce`` are never stored. The ``state`` comes back in
the URL and the ``nonce`` comes back inside the ID token, so both can be hashed
and compared; the PKCE verifier is the one value that must come back out, and
it is sealed with the product's single :class:`TokenEncryptor` exactly as the
account-linking flow seals its own.
