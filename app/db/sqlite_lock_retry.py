"""The single place SQLite write-lock contention is classified and reported.

Startup stamps two insert-if-absent sentinels into ``runtime_sentinels``
(the encryption-key fingerprint and the hard-sticky outage-grace marker).
Both are the first statement of their transaction on a fresh connection, so
neither can be protected by ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` (there is no earlier read to
upgrade), and on a loaded host either can lose the writer slot and surface
``database is locked`` (issue #1949). The window is short and self-healing,
so a small bounded retry is the whole fix; it is shared here so both call
sites keep one budget and one diagnostic instead of drifting apart.

The diagnostic matters as much as the retry: ``database is locked`` is
emitted for two opposite mechanisms that only ``sqlite_errorname``
separates. ``SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`` (a stale WAL snapshot that cannot be
upgraded) returns immediately and a retry on a fresh transaction fixes it;
``SQLITE_BUSY`` returns only after the full ``busy_timeout``, meaning
another writer held the slot that long and the retry budget is irrelevant.
Logging the name plus the elapsed time makes the next occurrence
self-classifying.

Every site that classifies a SQLite lock failure routes through
:func:`is_sqlite_lock_error` here, so one message set describes "transient
write-lock contention" process-wide instead of each module carrying its own
drifting substring list. Sites that keep their own hand-rolled retry budget
(the API-key usage-reservation writes and the refresh-claim upsert) call
:func:`should_retry_after_sqlite_lock` for the predicate, the diagnostic and
the backoff while keeping their own attempt count and their own re-raise;
sites that deliberately fail fast and let their next tick retry (leader
election's best-effort shutdown lease writes) call the predicate directly.
