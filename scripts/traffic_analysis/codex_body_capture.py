"""Capture a real Codex Responses request body with no upstream contact.

One command. No ChatGPT credentials, no quota, no network egress:

    uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.codex_body_capture \
      --model gpt-5.5 --model gpt-5.6-sol --transport http \
      --out /mnt/scratch/tmp/codex-body-capture-$(date -u +%Y%m%d)

How it stays isolated:

* **Kernel-enforced, and verified by observation.** The script re-executes
  itself inside an unprivileged network namespace (``unshare --map-root-user
  --net`` plus ``ip link set lo up``), then asks the kernel which interfaces
  that namespace has and refuses to capture unless loopback is the only one. "No
  upstream Codex call" is a property of the sandbox that the run measures, not a
  restatement of the flags it was given.
* **No credentials.** A throwaway ``CODEX_HOME`` and a provider with
  ``requires_openai_auth = false`` and a disposable ``env_key`` token. The
  script refuses to start if an exported ``CODEX_HOME`` holds an ``auth.json``
  or if the environment carries any production/proxy variable.
* **Captured in the origin, not in a proxy.** The loopback origin receives
  plaintext HTTP and persists the decoded request bytes itself, reusing
  ``origin_fixture.decode_request_body``. No TLS, no mitmproxy addon and no
  ``uvx`` capture boundary -- the parity lane's three moving parts.

It does need the project environment, which is what ``uv run`` above supplies:
the origin is FastAPI plus uvicorn, and the request decoder is ``zstandard``.
A bare interpreter fails at import, and on many hosts ``python`` is not even a
command. Nothing here needs the application configured, only importable: this
module reads no settings and touches no database.

Why the catalog must be pinned: the Codex model manager invalidates its cache
on a ``client_version`` mismatch and caches for 300 s, so a capture run always
refetches ``/models`` from whatever base URL the provider names. The origin
therefore serves a catalog file and records its digest as provenance.
``--catalog`` defaults to ``DEFAULT_CATALOG``, the committed reference catalog
that produced the fixture corpus; its digest is the ``catalog_sha256`` those
provenance entries record, so any operator can reproduce a capture and verify
the recorded digest. To capture against a different model set, point
``--catalog`` at a Codex ``/models`` response -- the shape Codex itself caches
as ``$CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json``, an object with a ``models`` array whose
entries the client deserialises strictly. The catalog does not fully determine
the body: 0.154.0 layers bundled ``model_info`` overrides on top of it (a row
saying ``supports_search_tool: false`` still yields ``web_search`` and
``tool_search`` declarations), which is why the CLI version is the primary
provenance key and the catalog digest is secondary.

What CI covers: the guards and the naming are pure functions
(``tests/unit/test_codex_body_capture_guards.py``), and the origin is driven
over both transports with a test client
(``tests/unit/test_codex_body_capture_origin.py``). Only the orchestration -- the
namespace re-exec, the uvicorn thread and ``codex`` itself -- stays outside CI.
